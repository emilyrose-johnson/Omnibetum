# Programming Assignment 2
#
# This program is a word game called Omnibetum that presents 7 letters to the user
# and the user than has to make as many valid words as possible from those letters.
# This program keeps track of the letters that the user is allowed, the users
# name, score and the words that the user has come up with.
# This program will continue to run until the user enters "q" which runs
# an exit message for the user
